# Project 3: Case Management System

Challenge: Modernize the Montana Judicial Branch’s outdated, paper-based court operations by leading the implementation of a digital case management system.

Context: The existing system made it difficult to track cases, access information quickly, and operate efficiently. A large-scale digital transformation was needed to streamline workflows and improve public service delivery across the judicial branch.

Action: As the project manager, I led the initiative using a structured project management framework. I developed a detailed project plan, managed timelines and budgets, coordinated with stakeholders, and identified and mitigated risks. I ensured clear communication among technical teams, court staff, and leadership while aligning the system’s development with organizational goals.

Results: The digital system replaced manual processes with a centralized platform, improving case tracking, enhancing data accessibility, and increasing operational efficiency. The project was delivered on time and within budget, supporting long-term improvements in accountability and service quality.

Reflection: This project deepened my experience in project management and highlighted the value of planning, coordination, and stakeholder engagement when driving organizational change. It showed how thoughtful leadership can help deliver sustainable solutions that support public-sector modernization.
