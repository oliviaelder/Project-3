# Project 3: Case Management System
Challenge: Design a case management system.

Context: For the case management system, the goal was to provide a system where legal professionals could manage their cases, track relevant documents, and update case statuses. 

Action: I created a project plan, broke the work into smaller tasks, and set deadlines. I also tracked progress and managed team members to ensure the project stayed on schedule.

Results: The main challenge was managing multiple tasks and ensuring that everything was completed on time. I used project management tools and regular check-ins to keep the project moving forward.

Reflection: This project helped me improve my project management skills, particularly in organizing tasks, managing timelines, and working with a team to meet goals.
